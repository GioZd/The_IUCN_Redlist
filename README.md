# The_IUCN_Redlist
This project explains what the IUCN Red List is and provides a small software that allows to explore a wide range of animals (Chordata).
Datasets are not provided due to IUCN files ridistribution policy and size limits of GitHub, nevertheless, datasets can be downloaded at https://www.iucnredlist.org .
More precisely, at [this query link](https://www.iucnredlist.org/search?taxonomies=100012&searchType=species) there's a drop down menu named "download". After pressing on "Search Summary", login, download files and unzip them in the same folder as the python files.
Finally the ultimate project is available for running.
